orthogonal is a 90-degree rot /
the cross product is for kai hella hot /
in a way and for a reason which u know not
the dot product is very specific /
as a dot is, just a small spot /
but for kai, that cross product is terrific /

square stacking is so compact /
but circles go winding and binding /
rectangles are so exact /
but with those elongated ellipses /
we can chart those celestial eclipses

just waiting for that inner fire /
which might just ignite /
when that hour's very, very dire /
for this is a cosmos of magic and might

and in this, our 3rd dimension /
we enjoy a special, special crossly ascension /
look on the interwebz for a torque gif /
if u want to see my riff/drift /
and in the dimension 7 /
descension, ascension, Revan?!?!?!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czU6H3GPkYo
